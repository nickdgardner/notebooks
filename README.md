A repository for publishing the data and (Python) code used in my dissertation research. 

Currently only contains some related pre-dissertation work, as placeholder examples. Eventually will contain similar expository notebooks showing the workflow to reproduce all computational tasks in the dissertation: 
1. **data acquisition** (web-scraping, text/table extraction from PDFs and scanned documents)
2. **data cleaning/wrangling** (text-processing, working with dataframes)
3. **data visualization and analysis** (causal modeling, statistical inference)
