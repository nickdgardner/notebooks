A repository for publishing the code (Python) and data used in my dissertation research. 

Currently contains miscellaneous older work. Eventually will
contain expository notebooks showing the full workflow for reproducing all computational tasks in the dissertation: from *data acquisition* (web-scraping, scanned documents), to *data cleaning/wrangling* (text-processing, work with dataframes), to *data analysis/visualization*
